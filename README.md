# VLE Scraper

Simple tool for downloading Virtual Learning Environment content locally. Currently working only for Panopto Videos. 

Tested on University of York's CompSci flow (2020) and not guaranteed to work for any other Blackboard based VLEs.

Uses [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/index.html) and assumes that the [Chrome Driver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) is added on your path.

### TODO list
 1. PDF downloader
 2. Module scraper (lectures, practicals, assessments)
 3. UI
 4. UNIX paths support
 3. pip integration
